# GUESS-THE-NUMBER!

Guess-The-Number is a Python based application fully run within the terminal. 

This app runs 3 core programs:
1. Guess-The-Number: The Player has to guess a randomly generated number.
2. Guess-The-Number (AI): Same as above, except this time, the computer has to try to guess the player's number!
3. Coin-Toss: A bonus program that simulates 'flipping a coin' with the computer. 

This application explores the posibilites of automation with Python, handling user inputs and random 
outcomes through the use of functions. 

The desired goals from the perspective of myself and for the player reflects this. I want to demonstrate what can be done with Python through the aim of creating 3 programs that can simulate random game events that the user is likely to have played in real life, whether attempting to guess a number that their friend was thinking of to flipping a coin to decide on who goes first in a game.

Guess-The-Number is deployed on Heroku.

I sought inspiration from many different websites/sources for this project. 
With many thanks to the following:

- An example guessing game by PythonForBeginners: [PythonForBeginners Link_1](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/code-snippets-source-code/python-guessing-game)

- Lessons on a 2 guessing games inspired this project from freeCodeCamp.org: [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg&list=WL&index=1)
- Superb information on handling user inputs: [TowardsDataScience](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-complete-guide-to-user-input-in-python-727561fc16e1#:~:text=Python%20provides%20a%20simple%20framework%20for%20getting%20user%20input.,input%20into%20the%20required%20format.)
- "Key by Value" solution for my coin toss game inspired by this answer on Stack Overflow: [Stack Overflow Link_1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8023306/get-key-by-value-in-dictionary)

I couldn't have done this project without the help of some key individuals:

- Daisy McGirr - My Code Institute mentor. Helped guide my along the course with advice on scope and assesment criteria, as well as ideas for the project.
- Nickolay Ninov - A massive thanks to Nickolay for providing so much help and support over the course of the project. He helped me resolve bugs and issues that I'd have been stuck on without his help!
- London C.I Community - Providing encouragement and feedback for my project which is always welcome. They continue to support as per my previous projects and are a great group to be a part of!
