# GUESS-THE-NUMBER!

Guess-The-Number is a Python based application fully run within the terminal. 

This app runs 3 core programs:
1. Guess-The-Number: The Player has to guess a randomly generated number.
2. Guess-The-Number (AI): Same as above, except this time, the computer has to try to guess the player's number!
3. Coin-Toss: A bonus program that simulates 'flipping a coin' with the computer. 

This application explores the posibilites of automation with Python, handling user inputs and random 
outcomes through the use of functions. 

The desired goals from the perspective of myself and for the player reflects this. I want to demonstrate what can be done with Python through the aim of creating 3 programs that can simulate random game events that the user is likely to have played in real life, whether attempting to guess a number that their friend was thinking of to flipping a coin to decide on who goes first in a game.

Guess-The-Number is deployed on Heroku.
