# Computer has to guess a number generated by the User

# User chooses a number
# Computer makes a guess
# User gets an input to say if the number needs to be lower or higher
# Continues until computer gets to the correct number
# prompt to play again or something else

# Coin Toss (Heads/Tails)

# Program begins when user presses a key
# User calls in an input whether they think it will be heads or tails
# The computer makes a guess of its own 
# The 'coin' is flipped and a result is generated
# See who wins the round 
# Prompt to either 'flip a coin' again or do something else
